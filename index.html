	<h2> Howdy!</h2>
	<p>Welcome to my e-Website! I am senior human resources development major at <a href="http://tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University</a>.
	I am involved in a Delta Gamma<a href="http://tamudg.wixsite.com/aggiedeltagamma">Delta Gamma</a> as an active member since freshman year. I have been able to serve on the board of panhellenic as a director of the recruitment counselors,
	where I created and implement training to over sixty women. It lead me to have to stay in college station this summer which was an amazing experience. This summer I also was able to travel to alaska where I got to ride with some sled dogs. 
	I went with my family which consist of me, my twim sister, and two older brothers. My twin sister and I are not alike at all, except she too attends Texas A&M University. I am glad to have family at school with me and sad that my time
	here is coming to an end.
	</p>
	<p> As you may have noticed, I am a loud and proud member of the Fighting Texas Aggie Class of 2017. 
	A-Whoop! However, I did not always know that I wanted to come here. I had applied to other schools and took other campus visits but nothing really stuck. After getting to experience a game at kyle field<a href="http://gameday.12thman.com/">Kyle Feild</a>
	I was sold on the school. Texas A&M is such a great campus with so many places to get involved. I have already told you about my personl affliations but one that is also important to me is my professional organizaion, ASHRD 
	<a href="https://stuactonline.tamu.edu/app/organization/profile/public/id/1660">ASHRD</a>, which stands for aggie stundents in HRD. This organization invites other companies to come and speak to us about what life in HR is like. It has given me
	a better understanding of what HR is and what it means to me. I will be forever thankful for all the organizations I am in and to A&M for allowing me to have such a network.
	</p>
	<p>Thanks and Gig'Em!</p>

	<p>So now I will tell you a little about my self. I have already told you a little about who I am personally but now I would like to go into my professional goals. Like I <i>said</i> I am majoring in human resources so I would love to be able to get a career in that field. 
	I am <b>mostly interested</b> in the feilds of recruiting and talent aquisition. I <u>love</u> interacting with others and think that a career in recruiting would be very interesting. I am currently in the process of interview for full time jobs, which can be stressful but makes me more than hopefull. 
	I am hoping to lock down a full time job that I love by the time I graduate in May.</p>
